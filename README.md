### 🚀 About Me

I am a results-driven engineer focused on building robust, accessible, and high-performance web applications. I bridge the gap between complex backend logic and intuitive frontend design. My expertise lies in the JavaScript ecosystem, cloud infrastructure, and delivering production-ready code that drives business value.

Currently, I am focused on:
*   **Architecting** scalable single-page applications (SPAs).
*   **Optimizing** frontend performance and Core Web Vitals.
*   **Developing** secure RESTful APIs and microservices.
